If the researcher incorrectly analyzes the data by calculating the mean satisfaction score and treating it as interval data, they might erroneously conclude that the average satisfaction level accurately represents the respondents' opinions. However, this interpretation ignores the fact that the Likert scale does not have equal intervals between the response options, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about the true satisfaction levels. Understanding the level of measurement would guide the researcher to use appropriate non-parametric tests or ordinal regression to accurately analyze and interpret the data."
